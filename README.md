## [ＷＩＰ] - Doom-Nukem : 𝙋𝙧𝙤𝙟𝙚𝙘𝙩: 𝘿𝙧𝙤𝙬𝙣𝙞𝙣𝙜

This work-in-progress C project is about creating a 3D polygonal game with ray-casting technique, that utilizes no GPU. Just like the breakthrough shooter games in the 90s. 

<b>It will be finished by April 2023.</b>

This is a survival game about getting back to the surface in the bottom of a deep lake. A beast-like creature dwells beneath the waves, prowling for easy prey. The player needs to have quick wits and a cool head to get back to safety.

As of January 24th 2023, the work became a  collaboration project with @Dofidog (Topi Paaso) and @UItsi (Timo Turto).
