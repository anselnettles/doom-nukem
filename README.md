<b>It will be finished by April 2023.</b><br><br>

This C program is tagged with my school's "42" user account "aviholai". <br>
As of January 24th 2023, the work became a  collaboration project with @Dofidog (Topi Paaso) and @UItsi (Timo Turto).<br>

## Controls:
<b>• `F3` toggles Dev Mode.</b><br>
Developer mode off color filters and overlay textures. Allows the user to swim upwards by tapping the jump key.<br><br>

## Making of:
#
In very early stages of development, we were still examining draw distancing, texture scaling and the conversion of the map file.
