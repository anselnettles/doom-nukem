<i>Summary: This C project is about creating a 3D polygonal game with ray-casting technique, that utilizes no GPU. Just like the breakthrough shooter games in the 90s. </i><br><br>
This was the final "core-studies project" of the game-graphics branch in HIVE Helsinki, A "42-style" coding school. The goal of the project is to create a first-person game in a "3D graphic representation". This would have to be achieved via a raycasting method. No computer hardware acceleration and no 3D library are allowed.<br><br>

<div align ="center">Everything in this project was coded from scratch by a group of three – in C language.<br><br>

<div align="left"><b>This game features:</b><br>

<p><input size="120">
• Real-time three-dimensional movement and view angles via keyboard and mouse.<br> 
• A feature-rich game stage, with a variety of environmental heights, nooks and un-even terrain.<br>
• Fully original textured environmental graphics, parsed internally from a HEX graphics map.<br> 
• Collectible items, environmental events and details that are constantly shifting.<br> 
• A level-editor that allows the user to edit and adjust the game stage to their likings.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;<sup><b>Project Drowning will be fully finished by April 2023.</sup></b>
#

This C program is tagged with my school's "42" user account "aviholai". <br>
As of January 24th 2023, the work became a  collaboration project with @Dofidog (Topi Paaso) and @UItsi (Timo Turto).<br>

<h3>Controls:</h3>

<b>• `W`, `A`,`S`,`D`, moves and strafes the player underwater. `Left Shift` allows you to run.</b><br>
 &emsp;&emsp;<sup>The player slowly builds up speed and momentum when in motion, making stopping also more difficult.</sup><br>
<b>• `E` picks up items.</b><br>
<b>• `Space` lets you jump.</b><br>
<b>• `F3` toggles Dev Mode.</b><br>
 &emsp;&emsp;<sup>Developer mode off color filters and overlay textures. Allows the user to swim upwards by tapping the jump key.</sup><br><br>

<h3>Making-of footage:</h3>

 &emsp;&emsp;<sup>In very early stages of development, we were still examining draw distancing, texture scaling and the conversion of the map file.</sup>
